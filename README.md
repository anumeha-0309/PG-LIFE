### About the Project

**PG-Life** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the search for Paying Guest (PG) accommodations in major Indian cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. This project was created to address the challenges faced by individuals seeking reliable and well-reviewed PG options in these bustling metropolitan areas.

- **Reliable Data**: Ensuring that all listings are accurate and up-to-date with user reviews and contact information.

### Features

- **City-Specific Listings**: Access detailed information on PG accommodations in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. Each city has its own dedicated section for targeted searches.
- **Search and Filter Options**: Use advanced search and filter tools to narrow down PG options based on criteria such as location, price range, and amenities.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Read reviews and see ratings from previous tenants to gauge the quality and reliability of each PG.

- **User Account Management**: (If applicable) Manage your own PG listings, save favorite PGs, and track your inquiries through user accounts.

### How It Works
